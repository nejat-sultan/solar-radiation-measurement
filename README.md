Solar Data Analytics Project
Welcome to the Solar Data Analytics repository. This project is part of a week-long challenge aimed at analyzing solar radiation data from three West African countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The challenge forms a critical evaluation component of a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to carry out comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on environmental and solar radiation data to generate meaningful insights. Based on this analysis, the project aims to provide strategic recommendations for the optimal placement of solar farms. Additionally, the project features the development of a Streamlit Dashboard to visually represent these insights.

Key Components
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A thorough analysis of the solar and environmental data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations.
Identifies potential opportunities and challenges in solar farm placement by understanding variables such as temperature, solar radiation, and location-specific factors.
2. Statistical Analysis
Application of statistical methods to support data-driven insights and predictions.
Use of techniques such as correlation analysis, trend analysis, and hypothesis testing to validate results and guide decision-making.
3. Streamlit Dashboard
An interactive dashboard developed using Streamlit, designed to present key findings in a user-friendly format.
Enables real-time exploration of data and visual insights, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.
4. CI/CD Implementation
Integration of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure smooth testing, deployment, and maintenance of the project.
Automated testing and workflows to maintain code quality and facilitate easy updates.

Technologies Used:

Python for data analysis and dashboard development.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data insights.
Streamlit for building the interactive dashboard.
GitHub Actions for implementing CI/CD pipelines.
Pytest for automated testing.
